Projects
AI-Powered Threat Detection System
Developed an AI-based threat detection system that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze network traffic and detect suspicious patterns in real-time. This system significantly reduced false positives and improved overall security posture.

SecureWebApp
Created a secure web application with a focus on robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. Implemented role-based access control and conducted extensive penetration testing to ensure its resilience against common web vulnerabilities.

Incident Response Automation
Designed and implemented an incident response automation framework that streamlines the process of identifying and mitigating security incidents. This reduced response time and minimized potential damage.
